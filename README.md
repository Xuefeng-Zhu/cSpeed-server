## About us
We are computer scientists at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working on making the Internet faster. The first step, of course, is to measure how fast the Internet is today. We developed Chronograph with twin objectives: (a) to measure Internet speed from a diverse set of locations and ISPs; and (b) to provide you a way of comparing Internet service options in your area. The bandwidth numbers (Mbps / Gbps) ISPs and other 'speed tests' report are not as meaningful as the actual performance we measure.

## Overview
cSpeed measures how fast your Internet really is. It does so by directly observing how much time it takes to load popular webpages. **It does not collect any personal web-browsing information.** It only measures load times for a list of popular sites. We do record your IP address, city, and browser user-agent (which includes your operating system and browser version). In addition to launching and measuring load times of websites, we also run a small javascript test to estimate your computer's computational power.
